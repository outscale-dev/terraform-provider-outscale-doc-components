  add:
    admin_password: (Windows VM only) The administrator password of the VM. This password is encrypted with the keypair you specified when launching the VM and encoded in Base64. You need to wait about 10 minutes after launching the VM to be able to retrieve this password.<br />If `get_admin_password` is false or not specified, the VM resource is created without the `admin_password` attribute. Once `admin_password` is available, it will appear in the Terraform state after the next **refresh** or **apply** command.<br />If `get_admin_password` is true, the VM resource itself is not considered created until the `admin_password` attribute is available.<br />Note also that after the first reboot of the VM, this attribute can no longer be retrieved. For more information on how to use this password to connect to the VM, see [Accessing a Windows Instance](https://wiki.outscale.net/display/EN/Accessing+a+Windows+Instance).

# To manage subparameters, you must specify all parameter levels separate by periods.
# For example, for attributes of plural data sources, you must always specify the object name pluralized.
